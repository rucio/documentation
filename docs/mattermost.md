title: How to join Rucio mattermost
---

We have a dedicated Mattermost Workspace where developers and administrators exchange and discuss all things Rucio. 
The Rucio Mattermost workspace is hosted on the CERN Mattermost service which requires a CERN account to join.

Please note that this is not an user support workspace, and we cannot help with experiment-specific user questions. 
## Join with a CERN account

1. Open https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/rucio/ in your browser or with a
mattermost client application.

## Join without a CERN account

or to sign in with a social account.
