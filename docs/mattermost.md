title: How to join Rucio mattermost
---

We have a dedicated Mattermost Workspace where developers, administrators, and
users exchange and discuss all things Rucio. The Rucio Mattermost workspace is
hosted on the CERN Mattermost service which requires a CERN account to join.

## Join with a CERN account

1. Open https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/rucio/ in your browser or with a
mattermost client application.

## Join without a CERN account

1. You will need to create a CERN lightweight account. Go to
https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/ and follow the procedure to create
your account.

2. Open https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/rucio/ in your browser or with a
mattermost client application.
