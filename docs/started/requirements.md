Rucio relies on several dependencies, some of them being a hard requirement,
others being optional depending on the used Rucio functionality.

To install Rucio, we generally recommend a Kubernetes-based deployment based on
our [helm-charts](https://github.com/rucio/helm-charts). A direct deployment
using Rucio [docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/rucio), or Rucio
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/rucio/) packages is also possible.

## Python

Rucio server, daemons and clients are written in Python and thus depend on an
installed Python interpreter.
