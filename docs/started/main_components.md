Rucio is based on a distributed system architecture & can be sectioned into four
major layers:

## Clients

The clients layer consists of components such as the command line clients (CLI),
Python clients, and the Javascript-based web user interface and configuration.

## Server

The server layer serves the purpose of authentication & provides a common API
for interaction with clients & other external application, as also the Web UI.

## Core

This layer consists of all the Rucio-level abstractions that are explained at
length in the Concepts section.

## Daemons

The daemons layer takes care of all the asynchronous & continuous workflows in
the background.

A diagrammatic representation of the 4 layers is as shown below
