title: SIG Metadata
---

## Objective

The purpose of this SIG is to reach out to communities who are either already using 
Rucio's metadata functionality or interested in using it, to ascertain if the 
functionality currently provided in this area is sufficient for their current and 
expected future use cases. This information will be distilled into the form of a 
small report, where, if missing functionality is identified, the report will serve 
to aggregate any similar requests and prioritise them, with the goal of delivering 
a tentative roadmap to guide development.

## Expected End-Date

End of 2023

## Means to achieve the objective

- Mattermost channel: [#metadata](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/rucio/channels/metadata)
- eMail list: rucio-sig-metadata@cern.ch
- ad hoc meetings with interested communities either over Zoom or asynchronously 
  over Mattermost.
