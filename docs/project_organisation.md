title: Project Organisation
---

Rucio is organised as a community-driven, open-source, project.
An open development team, comprised of technical experts rooted in the scientific
community, drives the development based on expertise, technical best-practices and
input from their respective communities. This openness is core to the identity and
the success of the project.

To organise the daily development work as well as the long-term strategic objectives
of the software, the project consists of several entities described on this page.

A list of members of the current "Core Team" can be seen [here](https://rucio.cern.ch/team.html).

## Project leader

The project leader has the overall responsibility of steering the project. This
includes coordinating, planning, and assessing the development activity of the
Rucio developers.

## Component leads

The [component leads](component_leads.md) take formal responsibility in planning
and developing contributions for their respective components. They are the
core experts and the point-of-contact in case of issues as well as to guide new
developments within their components.

## Rucio Advisory Board

The primary function of the Rucio advisory board (RAB) is to provide expertise from
representatives of Rucio communities and to advise the Rucio project leader.
Long-term priorities and plans of communities should be discussed by the RAB in order
to advise on the alignment of Rucio project objectives and plans. This should also
lead to the identification of common objectives to form common development efforts.
The resource and person-power situation within the Rucio project, the discussion and
identification of funding streams and collaboration on funded projects are also
within the scope of the RAB. The Rucio project lead communicates the advice given by
the advisory board to the development team.

Detailed mandate and responsibility of the board can be found [here](rucio_advisory_board.md).

## Special Interest Groups

Rucio Special Interest Groups (SIG) serve the purpose to offer a forum for interested users,
operators, and developers to discuss and plan the evolution of a specific part of Rucio.
The topic of a SIG needs to be well-defined and the community interest on the topic
needs to be above a threshold to justify the creation of a SIG, instead of covering the
topic just within the weekly Rucio meeting. A SIG topic can involve one or multiple
Rucio components, or even the entire system. SIGs are open to any interested community
member.

Detailed information for Rucio SIGs can be found [here](special_interest_groups.md).

## Contributors / Developers

Rucio could not exist without the numerous contributors who spent their valuable time
to improve the software. A list of contributors can be seen [here](about_our_contributors).
