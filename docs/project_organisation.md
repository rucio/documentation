title: About Project Organisation
---

Rucio is organised as a community-driven, open-source, project.
An open development team, comprised of technical experts rooted in the scientific 
community, drives the development based on expertise, technical best-practices and 
input from their respective communities. This openness is core to the identity and
the success of the project.

To organise the daily development work as well as the long-term strategic objectives
of the software, the project consists of several entities described on this page.

# Project leader

The project leader has the overall responsibility of steering the project. This 
includes coordinating, planning, and assessing the development activity of the 
Rucio developers. 

# Component leads

The [component leads](component_leads.md) take formal responsibility in planning
and developing contributions for their respective components. They are the 
core experts and the point-of-contact in case of issues as well as to guide new 
developments within their components.

# Rucio Advisory Board

The primary function of the Rucio advisory board (RAB) is to provide expertise from 
representatives of Rucio communities and to advise the Rucio project leader. 
Long-term priorities and plans of communities should be discussed by the RAB in order 
to advise on the alignment of Rucio project objectives and plans. This should also 
lead to the identification of common objectives to form common development efforts. 
The resource and person-power situation within the Rucio project, the discussion and 
identification of funding streams and collaboration on funded projects are also 
within the scope of the RAB. The Rucio project lead communicates the advice given by 
the advisory board to the development team.

Detailed mandate and responsibility of the board can be found [here](/documentation/files/Rucio_Advisory_Board.pdf).
