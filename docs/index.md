Rucio is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing scientific
collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across facilities at
multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed by
[the ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/)

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. It is a data management
solution that could cover the needs of different communities in the scientific
domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).

Below are some resources to help you get you started on your journey. 

## [Before You Get Started](Before-you-get-started)

What exactly is Rucio? What were the motivations behind developing such a system? Who
uses it? What powers these systems? Answers to all these questions and more can be
found by browsing through the sub-sections of this topic.

## Try Rucio!

Get your hands dirty by trying to setup your very own demo environment on your local
laptop/desktop. Make sure you read the pre-requisites section before starting off, though!

- [Rucio executables](bin.md)

## Rucio User Playground

Congratulations on setting up your Rucio environment! Let us now have a look at some of
the common things you can do using Rucio by setting up the Rucio client. Also, this
section will introduce you to some common CLI commands that you, as a user, might find
helpful when working with Rucio.

## Rucio Operator Documentation

This section of the documentation deals with some of the material that an operator or
administrator of a Rucio environment would require. For example, how to install a server
or some quick tips for working with the administrative CLI. Take a deep dive, but not
before you ensure you've read through the pre-requisites section under each of the topics!
