Rucio is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing
scientific collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across
facilities at multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio was originally
developed to meet the requirements of the high-energy physics experiment
[ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/), and now is continuously extended to support the
LHC experiments and other diverse scientific communities.

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. It is a data
management solution that covers the needs of different communities in the
scientific domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).

Below are some resources to help you get you started on your journey.

## Getting Started

What exactly is Rucio? What were the motivations behind developing such a
system? Who uses it? What powers these systems? Answers to all these questions
and more can be found by browsing through the sub-sections of this topic.

- [What is Rucio](started/what_is_rucio.md)
- [Main Components](started/main_components.md)
- [Additional Layers and Resources](started/additional_layers_and_resources.md)
- [About Rucio Daemons](started/daemons.md)

## Client

The rucio client enables users to interact with the system and access the
distributed data. The client can upload, download, manage and delete everything
from single files up to Petabyte sized datasets.

- [Using the Client](user/using_the_client.md)
- [Using the Admin Client](user/using_the_admin_client.md)

## Administration

This section of the documentation deals with some of the material that an
operator or administrator of a Rucio environment would require. For example, how
to install a server or some quick tips for working with the administrative
CLI. Take a deep dive, but not before you ensure you've read through the
pre-requisites section under each of the topics!

- [Monitoring](operator/monitoring.md)
- [Database](operator/database)
- [Configuration parameters](operator/configuration_parameters.md)

## Developer Documentation

Whether you want to develop with Rucio or contribute to the project, the
Developer documentation will help you get started. Peruse some common REST API &
Client API references that are directly derived from Rucio's python
libraries. We also have a contribution guide for those who wish to pitch in.

## Contributing to the Documentation

Documentation is always a work in progress and we welcome both, qualitative and
technical contributions, from the community. Make sure you look into the
[documentations GitHub repository](https://github.com/rucio/documentation) and
understand the pre-requisites before you submit your first PR!
