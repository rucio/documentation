title: Special Interest Groups
---

Rucio Special Interest Groups (SIG) serve the purpose to offer a forum for interested users,
operators, and developers to discuss and plan the evolution of a specific part of Rucio.
The topic of a SIG needs to be well-defined and the community interest on the topic
needs to be above a threshold to justify the creation of a SIG, instead of covering the
topic just within the weekly Rucio meeting. A SIG topic can involve one or multiple
Rucio components, or even the entire system. SIGs are open to any interrested community
member.

## Structure

Each SIG must define

  - A well-defined objective of the group (Creation of a report, Development of
    a functionality, ...)
  - An expected end-date
  - Means to achieve the objective, such as regular meetings, a mailing-list, mattermost
    channel, a workshop, ...
  - A convener
