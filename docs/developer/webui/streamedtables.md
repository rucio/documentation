title: Using the WebUI StreamedTable Component
---

## Data presentation in the WebUI
An issue we encountered in the process of developing the WebUI which is
particularly relevant in the context of writing a Rucio frontend is streaming.
The "old" web frontend (which we want to replace) had the issue that it would
freeze on starting larger queries, with no indication as to the progress made or
potential errors encountered. Even when everything worked well, these "freezes"
could last for up to several minutes in which the page was effectively unusable.

The reason for this was the fact that any responses from the Rucio server (which
supports streaming) were stored in a WebUI intermediary, before being forwarded
to the client in one batch. Since Rucio responses can be huge (and often, there
is no prior indication of the size which a query will take), this could lead to
freezing of unknown duration.

The solution would be to pass the stream from Rucio through the WebUI
backend/core to the frontend. This required special software engineering on the
backend, which shall not be covered here. The frontend accesses the streams via
a system called the `ComDOM`, short for `Communication Document Object Model`.
It accesses the streams provided by the backend API layer (and NOT the Rucio
server itself) and wraps the data with further tooling (to start/pause/stop the
stream, inspect the state, etc.).

:::note

Streamed data is unavoidable in the WebUI. The UI accesses this data in the form
of the `ComDOM`.

:::

The generic component when dealing with streamed data is the `StreamedTable`,
which is a custom HTML table framework based on [Tanstack
Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/introduction) and optimised for
use with the streams fed in via the ComDOM. A StreamedTable is defined by a set
of react props passed into the component (which will be described below). The
framework is completed by a plethora of ready-to-use components which solve the
majority of required usecases when it comes to streamed tables.

![StreamedTable Example](/img/webui/streamedtable.png)

## StreamedTable

The StreamedTable is a fully typed react component based on the HTML `table` element. The props it takes are defined in the codeblock below.

```typescript
type StreamedTableProps<T extends BaseViewModel> = JSX.IntrinsicElements["table"] & {
  tablecomdom: UseComDOM<T>
  tablecolumns: any[]
  tablestyling?: TableStyling
  tableselecting?: TableSelecting<T>
}
```

Explanation

1. The table expects a stream of elements of type `T`, where `T` extends the
`BaseViewModel`. In practice, this means that an entity is wrapped in an object
providing status and an optional errormessage.

2. The data shown by the table is passed into the `tablecomdom` prop as an
`UseComDOM` object. This object also provides functions to inspect and control
the stream. The generic `UseComDOM` type is bound to type `T`.

3. The table structure (i.e. the way data is structured into columns) is defined
by the `tablecolumns` prop. This is essentially an array of column definition
objects (which are taken from Tanstack Table), but there are exceptions, which
make typing this prop difficult. Most of your time building a streamedtable is
spent writing this definition.

4. The first optional prop, `tablestyling` is a structure containing style
commands for the table. The definition of the `TableStyling` type is given
below.

5. `tableselecting` optionally defines how the user can select (single- or
multi-select) elements from the table. It also controls the "breakout"
functionality. This is discussed later.

6. `JSX.IntrinsicElements["table"]` means that the StreamedTable component will
return a react component with the HTML `<table>` tag as its top-level component,
which in turn means that any valid HTML table-properties can be passed to the
StreamedTable, and these will be passed on to the top-level component. This
specifically also includes styling the top-level `<table>` via `className` but
also ARIA-properties.

### TableColumns
:::tip

When creating a new component or editing a new one, it is very useful to view the table in Storybook.

:::

The definition of the tablecolumns can be taken from the
[Tanstack Table Documentation](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/column-defs).
A simple example shall be discussed here nonetheless. The following code snippet
has been adapted from `PageDIDMetadata`, with custom styles and most custom
components removed for clarity.

```tsx
// imports and type definitions
import { createColumnHelper } from "@tanstack/react-table"
type DIDKeyValuePairViewModel = {
    // from DIDKeyValuePair entity
    key: string;
    value: string;

    // from BaseViewModel
    status: 'success' | 'error' | 'pending';
    message?: string;
}

// the streamedtable receives a stream of `DIDKeyValuePairViewModel`
// each element is converted into a row
// initialise the columnHelper to this type
const columnHelper = createColumnHelper<DIDKeyValuePairViewModel>()


// define the tablecolumns array
const tablecolumns: any[] = [
    // Accessor columns have an underlying data model which means they can be
    // sorted, filtered, grouped, etc.
    columnHelper.accessor("key", { // this column accesses the "key" attribute
        id: "key",
        // function to render each body cell of the column, return JSX object
        // "info" contains the value but also other useful context -> read docs
        cell: info => {
            return (
                <span>
                    {info.getValue()}
                </span>
            )
        },
        // funxtion to render header cell of column, return JSX object
        // "info": context useful for the creation of a header cell -> read docs
        header: info => {
            return (
                // this is a custom component that can be placed into the header
                // they are discussed further below
                <TableFilterString
                    column={info.column}
                    name="Key"
                />
            )
        }
    }
    ),
    columnHelper.accessor("value", { // column accesses the "value" attribute
        id: "value",
        cell: info => {
            return (
                <span>{info.getValue()}</span>
            )
        },
        header: info => {
            return (
                // must not use a custom component, a simple <h3> tag is fine!
                <h3>Value</h3>
            )
        }
    })
]
```

Passing this column definition into a StreamedTable together with the ComDOM supplying the data like so

```tsx
<StreamedTable<DIDKeyValuePairViewModel>
    tablecomdom={comdom}
    tablecolumns={tablecolumns}
/>
```

will return a fully functional StreamedTable. This can be expanded upon to
create much complex tables with multiple columns.

:::info

The StreamedTable is a wrapper for Tanstack Table. In particular, the column
definitions have been taken over unchanged. This means that the documentation
and examples provided by Tanstack are also valid in the StreamedTables, check
them out.

:::

### Common components for column headers

A number of reusable components have been added to the StreamedTable package
which can be used to implement frequently-needed functionality such as sorting
and filtering. An example of this has already been given in the code above, in
which a `TableFilterString` component used.

These components are added in the column header definitions within the
`tablecolumns` definition, i.e.

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("foo", {
    header: info => <TableCommonComponent bar={bar} />,
    ...
})
```

The remainder of this section will introduce each of the common table
components.


#### TableSortUpDown
This component toggles the Tanstack Table sorting mechanism on mouseclick and
cycles between no sorting, sorting in ascending order and sorting in descending
order. Examples of column entries which can be sorted are numeric data and
dates.

![TableSortUpDown Dirty](/img/webui/sort-updown-dirty.png) ![TableFilterBoolean Clean](/img/webui/sort-updown-clean.png)

It takes the following props:

```tsx
props: JSX.IntrinsicElements["div"] & {
    name: string
    column: Column<any, any>
    element?: JSX.Element
    stack?: boolean
    nocollapse?: boolean
}
```
Explanation:
* `name` is the string which will be used as the column header with a default
  style if no `element` is defined
* `column` is the table column the header belongs to.
* `element` is the JSX element which overrides `name`.
* `stack` determines whether the icon signifying the sorting state and the name
  element are stacked vertically instead of horizontally. The example picture
  above uses vertical stacking.
* `nocollapse` will force the `name` (or `element`) to remain visible even on
  small screen widths (below 768px).
* any props valid for a `div` element will also work.

#### TableFilterDiscrete

On mouseclick, it cycles through a list of keys and only displays the rows in
which the column entry matches the key. Used when the column data is restricted
to a small number of options, such as the Rucio enums.

![TableFilterDiscrete Dirty](/img/webui/filter-discrete-dirty.png) ![TableFilterDiscrete Clean](/img/webui/filter-discrete-clean.png)

```tsx
type TableFilterDiscrete<T> = JSX.IntrinsicElements["div"] & {
    name: string, // see TableSortUpDown
    keys: T[],
    renderFunc: (key: T | undefined) => JSX.Element,
    column: Column<any, T>, // see TableSortUpDown
    stack?: boolean // see TableSortUpDown
}
```
Explanation:
* `keys` is a list of type `T` where `T` is the tyoe of the column entries.
  Usually a string enum.
* `renderFunc` is the function used to render the icon to the side or below the
  text (depending on whether `state` is set).

#### TableFilterBoolean
A special form of `TableFilterDiscrete` in which the values are booleans. This
means that no `renderFunc` needs to be supplied.

![TableFilterBoolean in Action](/img/webui/filter-boolean-all.png)

```tsx
// see TableFilterDiscrete
type TableFilterBoolean = JSX.IntrinsicElements["div"] & {
    name: string,
    column: Column<any, boolean>,
    stack?: boolean
}
```

#### TableFilterString
A filter in which the column entries are strings.

![TableFilterString Dirty](/img/webui/filter-string-dirty.png) ![TableFilterString Clean](/img/webui/filter-string-clean.png)

```tsx
type TableFilterString = JSX.IntrinsicElements["form"] & {
    column: Column<any, string>, // see TableFilterDiscrete
    name: string, // see TableFilterDiscrete
    placeholder?: string,
}
```
Explanation
* `placeholder` is the placeholder string for the textbox
* this component is not derived from `div` but from `form`. Any attributes valid
  in `form` are also valid here.

:::tip

These common StreamedTable components are very helpful in reducing the
complexity of the column definitions you write. They also ensure a common design
language throughout the project. We encourage you to use them as much as
possible.

:::

### Common components for column cells
The selection here is quite limited right now, but shall be extended in order to
keep a common design language. It is also much easier to keep the project
accessible if the total number of unique components is kept low.

* `TableInternalLink` for links within the rucio webui
* `TableExternalLink` for links pointing outside of the rucio webui.

### TableStyling

:::info

As with the rest of the Rucio WebUI, the StreamedTable is styled via [Tailwind
CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This means that styles are constructed by
assigning various classes to an element. Tailwind will then compile a minimal
set of CSS.

:::

This optional StreamedTable attribute itself only contains optional members. It
is used to add to or override table styling settings.

```tsx
type TableStyling = Partial<{
    visibility?: Record<string, boolean>
    tableHeadRowStyle?: string
    tableBodyRowStyle?: string
    pageSize?: number
    tableFooterStack?: boolean
}>
```
Explanation:
* `visibility` maps a column's visibility (boolean) to the column id (string).
* `tableHeadRowStyle`: the classes which shall get passed to the `tr` in the
  `thead`.
* `tableBodyRowStyle`: the classes which shall get passed to each `tr` in the
  `tbody`.
* `pageSize` is how many rows are shown per page at maximum.
* `tableFooterStack` will stack table footer components in order to save
  horizontal space.

### Setting column widths

Column widths are set automatically, but they can be styled individually. This
is done by adding a string of class names to the column definition in the
following way:

```tsx
columnHelper.accessor("foo", {
    meta: {
        style: "w-28 md:w-56" // see tailwind documentation for an explanation
    },
    ...
})
```
The Tailwind compiler has been configured to consider these styles as well when
putting together the minimal set of CSS. Internally, the styles defined here are
applied to the header cell. Since the StreamedTable `table` element uses
`table-layout: fixed`, the column widths of the first row will be applied to
each of the following rows as well.

### TableSelecting
This optional table attribute handles selecting rows and the "breakout". The
breakout is an infopanel placed under the table which shows columns for a single
selected row (these columns would otherwise be hidden due to lack of horizontal
space), see the image below for an example.

```tsx
type TableSelecting<T> = { // where T is the type of the table rows
    handleChange: (data: T[]) => void,
    enableRowSelection: boolean,
    enableMultiRowSelection?: boolean,
    breakOut?: {
        breakoutVisibility: boolean,
        keys: Record<string, string>, // column id, displayname
    }
}
```
Explanation:
* `handleChange` is the function which is run each time the selection state
  changes.
* `enableRowSelection`: whether to enable row selection
* `enableMultiRowSelection`: whether to allow row multi-select (only valid if
  row selection is enabled)
* `breakout.breakoutVisibility`: whether to allow showing the breakout when a
  row is selected. Often coupled to the horizontal window size.
* `breakout.keys`: matching column id to the name under which it is to be
  displayed. The column ids determine which columns are going to be added to the
  breakout. Usually, these columns end up being the columns that were hidden due
  to lack of horizontal space.

![Table Breakout](/img/webui/breakout.png)

### NormalTable
The StreamedTable design is part of the design language of the Rucio WebUI, and
we intend for all tables (even if they are non-streaming) to follow this design.
It follows that we created the `NormalTable`, which keeps the same design as the
StreamedTable but without the streaming capabilities.

```tsx
type NormalTableProps<T> = JSX.IntrinsicElements["table"] & {
    tablecolumns: any[] // see StreamedTable
    tablestyling?: TableStyling // see StreamedTable
    tableselecting?: TableSelecting<T> // see StreamedTable
    tabledata: T[]
}
```
Explanation:
* `tabledata`: instead of passing a comdom which wraps the streamed data, we pas
  the data directly in the form of an array.

## StreamedTable in the context of NextJS
The StreamedTable relies on streams, which are rapped in the ComDOM. Until now,
we have taken the existence of a functioning ComDOM as given. In this section,
we will discuss how to properly embed the StreamedTable in the wider context of
the NextJS web application.

:::info

The frontend uses the NextJS app router. [Look at their
docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) to learn more.

:::

#### QueryClientProvider

On a layout-file affecting the route containing the StreamedTable, include the
following code:

```tsx
'use client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function RootLayout({children}) {
    return (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            {children}
        </QueryClientProvider>
    )
}
```
where `children` is a `React.ReactNode` containing the StreamedTable.

#### Route

On the route which returns the page including the StreamedTable, you must
initialise the ComDOM. You can optionally auto-start the ComDOM query or wait
for the user to trigger it manually -- this will not be covered in-depth here,
since this is more closely related to the ComDOM itself than to the
StreamedTable. An example, taken and adapted from the `ListSubscription` route,
would be:

```tsx
'use client';
import { ListSubscription as ListSubscriptionStory } from "@/component-library/Pages/Subscriptions/ListSubscription";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import useComDOM from "@/lib/infrastructure/hooks/useComDOM";
import { SubscriptionRuleStatesViewModel } from "@/lib/infrastructure/data/view-model/subscriptions";

export default function ListSubscription({ params }: { params: { account: string }}) {
    // initialise ComDOM
    const ComDOM = useComDOM<SubscriptionRuleStatesViewModel>(
        "subscription-rule-states-query",
        [],
        false,
        Infinity,
        50,
        true
    )
    // auto-start query, GET data from /api/list-subscription, use param account
    useEffect(() => {
        const runQuery = async () => {
            await ComDOM.start({
                url: new URL("http://localhost:3000/api/list-subscription"),
                method: "GET",
                headers: new Headers({
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                } as HeadersInit),
                params: {
                    "account": params.account,
                }
            })
        }
        runQuery()
    }, [])
    // * return a react component
    // * in this case the StreamedTable is wrapped by a Storybook Page
    // * we pass the ComDOM to this page so that it may be passed further down
    // to the StreamedTable
    return (
        <div>
            <ListSubscriptionStory
                accountname={params.account}
                comdom={ComDOM}
            />
        </div>
    )
}
```
