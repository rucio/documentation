## Requirements file structure

The dependencies needed by Rucio are described in the [`rucio/requirements/`](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/tree/master/requirements) directory.

The requirements in this directory are divided based on the application:

- `requirements.server*`: Dependencies needed to run the Rucio server and daemons
- `requirements.client*`: Dependencies needed to run the Rucio client
- `requirements.dev*`: Dependencies needed for testing and development

### `.in` and `.txt` files
- `.in` files represent input files to `pip-compile`. These list the **primary** dependencies.
    - For `client`, the `.in` file is not necessary, as we do not pin `client` dependencies.
- `.txt` files represent the actual requirements files used at installation time.
    - For `server` and `dev`, the `.txt` file is generated by `pip-compile`,
    pinning both **primary** and **secondary** dependencies.
    - For `client`, the `.txt` file is compiled manually,
    and only describes the **primary** dependencies.

## Updating dependencies

### `pip-compile` and compiling dependencies
We use `pip-compile` from [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) for `server` and `dev`
in order to ensure we pin secondary dependencies to specific versions,
to improve the stability of Rucio server, testing and development.
See [this issue](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/6694) for an example
of a CI issue that was caused by an unpinned secondary dependency.

### I want to add/remove/upgrade a `server` dependency. What should I do?
1. Make your changes in the `requirements.server.in` file
2. Run `pip-compile requirements.server.in`
3. Run `pip-compile requirements.dev.in`
  - (`dev` dependencies include dependencies from `requirements.server.txt`,
  so make sure to do these steps in order)

### I want to add/remove/upgrade a `dev` dependency. What should I do?
1. Make your changes in the `requirements.dev.in` file
2. Run `pip-compile requirements.dev.in`

### I want to add/remove/upgrade a `client` dependency. What should I do?
1. Make your changes in the `requirements.client.txt` file

## Major dependency upgrades
Dependencies are generally upgraded to the latest possible version on every Rucio major release.
This work is performed approximately a month prior to the major release,
in order to address possible breaking changes and monitor test outcomes and runtime behaviour for errors.

For secondary dependencies, `pip-compile --upgrade` is used. This flag attempts to upgrade
all secondary dependencies to their latest versions.

To perform this major dependency upgrade:
1. Manually update all primary dependencies (where possible; be mindful of breaking changes) in:
    1. `requirements.server.in`
    2. `requirements.dev.in`
    3. `requirements.client.txt`
2. Run `pip-compile --upgrade requirements.server.in`
3. Run `pip-compile --upgrade requirements.dev.in`

## Security updates
For critical security updates, we rely on [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)
to create alerts for dependencies listed in our requirements.

Dependabot supports `pip-compile`, and is able to automatically create PRs
to ugprade both primary and secondary dependencies.
When a primary dependency is upgraded in a `.in` file, Dependabot re-compiles
that file into the `.txt` file as well.

# FAQ

## Why are `client` dependencies not pinned?
In certain use cases, the Rucio client is used as a library in other applications
(See [this issue](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/issues/6663) for an example).
Because of this, `client` dependencies are left unpinned unless necessary.
