title: Rucio Advisory Board

## Mandate and responsibilities of the board

The primary function of the Rucio advisory board (RAB) is to provide expertise from
representatives of Rucio Science Communities (RSC) and to advise the Rucio project
leader. Long-term priorities and plans of communities should be discussed by the RAB
in order to advise on the alignment of Rucio project objectives and plans. This should
also lead to the identification of common objectives to form common development
efforts. The resource and person-power situation within the Rucio project, the
discussion and identification of funding streams and collaboration on funded projects
are also within the scope of the RAB. The Rucio project leader communicates the advice
given by the advisory board to the development team.

The board provides non-binding strategic advice and is informal in nature.

## Composition

The RAB is composed of a group of representatives of their respective RSC. The goal is
to complement the expertise of the development team, and thus representatives should
have knowledge about the long-term computing strategy of their community and ideally
have responsibility for their project programme and budget.

Membership in the RAB is by invitation of the Rucio project leader. However,
suggestions for expanding the board should ideally come from the RAB itself.
Representatives serve a 2-year, renewable, term. Invitations to join the board are
made to the legal representative of the RSC, typically the spokesperson or coordinator
charged with the computing portfolio of the community. The RSC should in return
nominate one representative from their community to join the board. Nominations are
discussed with the Rucio project leader who ultimately decides on the acceptance.

The Rucio project leader is an ex-officio member of the board and chairs the
board meetings.

### Eligibility criteria

There are no strict eligibility criteria for an RSC to be viable for having a
representative on the RAB. However the goal of the RAB is to have all science
communities, who utilize Rucio in production and who are significantly involved in the
development of the system, represented on the board. Such significance involves, but
is not limited to, long-term contributions of source-code, leadership roles as Rucio
component-leads, participation in hackathons and Rucio workshops, community support on
the Mattermost channel, etc.

## Organisation

The RAB meets as needed, nominally twice a year. Meetings generally take place
at CERN, with remote participation possibilities. The RAB members agree to
select a secretary for each meeting who will be in charge of keeping minutes.
Minutes are kept internal to the RAB.

Should a representative be exceptionally impeded to join a board meeting, they can 
nominate a replacement representative, from their RSC, to join the meeting. The 
replacement must be approved by the Rucio project leader.

Guests can be invited to parts, or the entirety, of a board meeting. Invitations are 
issued by the Rucio project leader and the RAB members must be informed, in advance, 
of the attendance of guests.
