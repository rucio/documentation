# Introduction

The major success of the Rucio project can, in large part, be traced back to the way 
the project is organised and how design decisions are made: An open development team, 
comprised of technical experts rooted in the scientific community, drives the 
development based on expertise, technical best practices and input from their 
respective communities[^1]. This recipe of success is core to the culture and identity 
of the Rucio project and must not change.

[~1:]: A Rucio Community usually describes, but is not limited to, a scientific collaboration/experiment using/contributing to Rucio


However, with the success of the project, and the on-boarding of many scientific 
communities, this process does have shortcomings which this proposal tries to address. 
Specifically, in the existing process long-term strategic perspectives of the 
involved scientific communities are not very well covered, simply because they are 
beyond the scope of the technical experts participating in the development team. For 
the same reason it is also difficult to address and discuss the identification of 
person-power, funding streams, and the common submission/participation in funded 
iprojects.

These shortcomings should be settled by complementing the existing process with the 
creation of a **Rucio Advisory Board**.

# Mandate and responsibilities of the board

The primary function of the Rucio advisory board (RAB) is to provide expertise from 
representatives of Rucio communities and to advise the Rucio project leader. 
Long-term priorities and plans of communities should be discussed by the RAB in 
order to advise on the alignment of Rucio project objectives and plans. This should 
also lead to the identification of common objectives to form common development 
efforts. The resource and person-power situation within the Rucio project, the 
discussion and identification of funding streams and collaboration on funded 
projects are also within the scope of the RAB. The Rucio project lead communicates 
the advice given by the advisory board to the development team.

The board provides non-binding strategic advice and is informal in nature.

# Composition

The RAB is composed of a group of community representatives. The goal is to 
complement the expertise of the development team, and thus representatives should 
have knowledge about the long-term strategy of their community and ideally have 
responsibility for their project programme and budget.

Membership in the RAB is by invitation of the Rucio project leader. However, 
suggestions for expanding the board should ideally come from the RAB itself. 
Representatives serve a 2-year, renewable, term. Invitations to join the board 
are made to the respective community itself, which should in return nominate one, 
exceptionally two, representatives to join the board. Nominations are discussed 
with the Rucio project leader.

The Rucio project leader is an ex-officio member of the board and chairs the 
board meetings.

# Organisation

The RAB meets as needed, nominally twice a year. Meetings generally take place 
at CERN, with remote participation possibilities. The RAB members agree to 
select a secretary for each meeting who will be in charge of keeping minutes. 
Minutes are kept internal to the RAB.
