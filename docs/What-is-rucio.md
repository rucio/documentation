Having demonstrated very large scale data management capabilities, Don Quijote
(DQ2), the **ATLAS Distributed Data Management System** used for **HEP
experiments at CERN** had reached its limits in terms of scalability. The
primary concerns were

- the requirement of a large number of support staff to operate.
- difficulty in interfacing with new technologies

To address these very scaling requirements for HEP experiments, **Rucio** as a
Distributed Data Management System was developed. Drawing benefits from advances
in Cloud & Big Data computations, it relies on a conceptual data model to ensure
system stability. Dataflow autonomy and automation are the key design principles
guiding the development of Rucio. To reduce the operational overheads of the
support staff, it employs an automation framework and also accounts for newer
use cases & user requirements of the LHC Run2 experiments.

## What can Rucio do

Standing on the shoulders of its predecessor, **ATLAS**, the capabilities of
Rucio are currently leveraged for:

- Storage of detector data, simulator data, and user data
- Unified interfacing of heterogenous network & storage infrastructure
- Support for newer protocols in Storage & Network using plugins
- Data Recovery
- Adaptive Replication
